# Fake News Detection

I developed a BERT-based sentiment analysis model that achieved **88% accuracy** and an **F1-score of 88.68%**. Over three training epochs, I optimized the model by reducing the loss from **0.6287 to 0.1300**, ensuring improved performance. Throughout the process, I identified signs of overfitting and explored techniques like regularization to enhance generalization. To evaluate the modelâ€™s effectiveness, I analyzed key performance metrics, including precision, recall, and classification reports, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of its accuracy and reliability.
