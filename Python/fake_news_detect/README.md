# Fake News Detection

This project uses the BERT Transformer of Hugging Face to detect fake news. The dataset from Kaggle contains 70,000+ data, which was processed and reduced to 1,000 data. After preprocessing and sharing the dataset, the model was trained for 5 epochs, resulting in a training loss of 0.426 and validation loss of 0.497. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of BERT in fake news detection.
